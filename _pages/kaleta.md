# Artificial Life Models in Software
## Chapter 10: Artificial Chemistries (Kaleta)

There is a thing called Chemical Organization Theory. Computer simulations generate a lot of data in a short time, which wet chemistries can't. "These fields try to understand real living systems not by considering them in mechanistic detail, but from an abstract point of view. Thus, they study how concepts like self-replication of information processing and storage might have evolved." Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML) is suggested as a standard for representation of reaction networks. Systems Biology Workbench (SBW) interfaces with a variety of programming languages and can load a reaction network specified in SBML and do analysis on it. Perhaps MetaChem can be implemented in XML?
